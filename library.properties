sentence=Discrete-time PID controller using Tustin (bilinear) transform with filtered derivative and integrator freeze anti-windup.
paragraph=Implements a robust, embedded-friendly PID controller using the Tustin (bilinear) transform for both integration and differentiation. Includes derivative filtering, integrator freeze on saturation, and deterministic state handling. Suitable for motor control, robotics, and real-time embedded systems.
